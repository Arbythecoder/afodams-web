## 🚀 LET'S START NOW - Day 1 Tasks

### Step 1: Fix MongoDB (You need to do this)

Choose one:

**Option A: Whitelist IP in MongoDB Atlas**
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Network Access → Add IP → Allow Access from Anywhere
3. Wait 2 minutes

**Option B: Use Local MongoDB**
```bash
# Install MongoDB locally or use Docker
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

Then update backend/.env:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/afodams-properties
```

### Step 2: Once MongoDB is fixed, I'll:
- ✅ Test all auth endpoints
- ✅ Create seed data
- ✅ Test frontend auth flow
- ✅ Make sure everything works before moving forward

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

I'll update this file daily with checkmarks ✅ for completed tasks.

**Current Status:** Day 1 - Waiting for MongoDB access to be fixed

**Next Action:** YOU fix MongoDB access, then I build systematically

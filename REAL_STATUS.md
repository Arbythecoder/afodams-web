# 🔥 AFODAMS PROPERTY - REAL STATUS & ACTION PLAN

**Updated:** November 17, 2025
**Current Status:** BUILDING TO UK PREMIUM STANDARDS

---

## ❌ HONEST ASSESSMENT - WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING

### Frontend (Pretty UI Only)
- ✅ **HomePage** - Beautiful design, no backend connection
- ❌ **Login** - Form exists but auth doesn't work yet
- ❌ **Signup** - Forms exist but don't save to database
- ❌ **Property Listing** - No real data yet
- ❌ **Landlord Dashboard** - Beautiful UI but needs working backend

### Backend (Partially Working)
- ⚠️ **Server** - Runs but MongoDB connection failing
- ⚠️ **Auth Routes** - Code exists but untested
- ⚠️ **Property Routes** - Code exists but untested
- ❌ **Database** - Connection issues (DNS error)

### What's Actually Production Ready
**NOTHING YET** - We have beautiful UI and backend code, but they're not connected and working.
